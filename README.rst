Abstract
********

We release the largest public ECG dataset of raw signals for representation
learning containing over 11k patients and 2 billion labelled beats. Our goal is
to enable semi-supervised ECG models to be made as well as to discover unknown
subtypes of arrhythmia and anomalous ECG signal events.

To this end, we propose an unsupervised representation learning task, evaluated
in a semi-supervised fashion. We provide a set of baselines for different
feature extractors that can be built upon.  Additionally, we perform
qualitative evaluations on results from PCA embeddings, where we identify some
clustering of known subtypes indicating the potential for representation
learning in arrhythmia sub-type discovery.
